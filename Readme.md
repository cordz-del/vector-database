# RAG System Implementation Repository

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end production-grade AI system that integrates a vector database (such as Pinecone, Chroma, or FAISS) with a large language model like GPT-4. The system enriches generated responses with relevant contextual data by retrieving and injecting information from indexed documents. It showcases my ability to build scalable, production-ready AI pipelinesâ€”from data ingestion and indexing to real-time retrieval and response generation.

## Overview

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
- Ingests and indexes documents using a vector database (Pinecone, Chroma, or FAISS).
- Retrieves the most relevant context for a given query.
- Feeds the retrieved context into GPT-4 to produce enriched, coherent responses.
- Demonstrates a full end-to-end pipeline designed for scalability and production-readiness, aligning with the AI Engineering Lead role requirements.

## Features

- **Vector Database Integration:**  
  Ingests data and creates vector representations for efficient retrieval using Pinecone, Chroma, or FAISS.

- **Real-Time Contextual Retrieval:**  
  Retrieves relevant documents or data points based on the user's query, which are then injected into the prompt for GPT-4.

- **LLM Integration:**  
  Uses GPT-4 to generate responses that are enhanced by the retrieved context, reducing ambiguity and increasing relevance.

- **Production-Grade Pipeline:**  
  Showcases a scalable and robust architecture suitable for deployment in production environments.

- **End-to-End Workflow:**  
  Covers data ingestion, indexing, real-time retrieval, prompt optimization, and response generation.

## Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion & Indexing:**  
   Data is processed and converted into vector representations using an embedding model. These vectors are stored in a vector database (Pinecone, Chroma, or FAISS).

2. **Contextual Retrieval:**  
   When a query is received, the system searches the vector database for the most relevant documents or snippets based on similarity scores.

3. **Prompt Enrichment & Response Generation:**  
   The retrieved context is injected into an optimized prompt that is sent to GPT-4, ensuring that the final response is both contextually rich and coherent.

4. **Response Delivery:**  
   The enriched response is returned to the user in real time.
